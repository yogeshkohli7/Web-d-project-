                    <h2>MAX</h2>
                    <p>Max, a lovable Labrador, was rescued through Furry Care,
                        where he found his forever home. After being cared for
                        and trained at our facility, he was adopted by a loving
                        family who welcomed him with open arms. Max now enjoys a
                        happy, fulfilled life, showing how Furry Care changes
                        lives through adoption.</p>

                    <p>Snowy, a sweet white puppy, was once abandoned and
                        lonely, waiting for a loving family to call her own.
                        When Snowy came to Furry Care, her bright eyes and
                        gentle nature captured everyone's heart. After spending
                        weeks in foster care, Snowy found her forever home with
                        a kind family who instantly fell in love with her
                        playful spirit.</p>
